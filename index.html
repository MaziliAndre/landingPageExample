            <h2>CASVAL REM DEIKUN</h2>
            <p>Born on November 17, U.C. 0059[2], as Casval Rem Deikun, son of Tor Deikun and Zeon Zum Deikun, founder of the Republic of Zeon. Sayla Mass (real name: Artesia Som Deikun) is his biological sister. After the death of Zeon Zum Deikun in 0069, he fled to Earth due to persecution by the Zabi family. At this time, under the patronage of Jimba Ral, who was a good friend of his father Zeon, he was adopted by the Mass family in southern Europe and took the name "Édouard Mass." Although his father Zeon is shown to have died of illness on record, he sees it as an assassination by Degwin Sodo Zabi and others (Jimba Ral) believe that his father's attempt to name Degwin as an assassin was disguised as naming his successor and he vows revenge on the Zabi family.</p>
            <br> <br>
            <p>Admission to Zeon Military Academy: <br>
                In the year 0074, he infiltrated under the name "Char Aznable" and entered Zeon Military Academy. During his time at the academy, he met and befriended Garma Zabi. He received excellent grades and was on track to graduate at the top of his class, but he disobeyed his superiors during an exercise just before graduation and lost his evaluation, giving Garma the top spot and graduating second in his class. In 0078, upon graduation, he enlisted in the Teaching Mobile Battalion under Kycilia Zabi.</p>
